# Data Binding

Data binding is the concept of linking model data to views, so that when the model data is changed, the views observing this data update automatically in response. Therefore, it is data binding which provides the mechanism for reactivity in Vizia.

In Vizia, data binding is achieved through the use of lenses. A lens is an object which allows you to *select* some part of a model and inspect its value. These lens objects are then used to form a binding between views and these parts of the model, updating when only these specific parts have changed.

## Lenses

The `Lens` derive macro can be used to generate a lens for each field of a struct. These lenses can then be used to transform a reference to the struct into a reference to each of its fields. The generated lenses are given the same name as the field and placed in a module with the same name as the struct. For example, given the following definition of some model data:

```rust
#[derive(Lens)]
pub struct AppData {
    color: Color,
}

impl Model for AppData {}
```

A lens to the `color` field of the `AppData` struct is generated as `AppData::color`. 

## Property Binding

We can then use this lens with the `background_color` modifier of a view to set up a binding, so that when the data changes the background color is updated. Passing lenses to modifiers is known as *property binding*.

```rust
#[derive(Lens)]
pub struct AppData {
    color: Color,
}

impl Model for AppData {}

fn main() -> Result<(), ApplicationError> {
    Application::new(|cx|{
        Label::new(cx, "Hello Vizia").background_color(AppData::color);
    }).run()
}
```

## View Binding 

Some views accept a lens as an input. When provided a lens, the view sets up a binding to the data. For example, the `Label` view accepts a lens to any type which implements `ToString`:

```rust
#[derive(Lens)]
pub struct Person {
    pub name: String,
}

impl Model for Person {}

fn main() -> Result<(), ApplicationError> {
    Application::new(|cx|{
        Label::new(cx, Person::name);
    })
    .run()
}
```
When the `name` field changes, the text of the label updates to show the new value.
